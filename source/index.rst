What is Deployer
________________
    
The Deployer project provides a command-line tool for automating the deployment of distributed systems developed in the Cloud
and Interactive Computing group (CIC) at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Currently, support for the following
projects is planned:

* TACC's Integrated JupyterHub
* Abaco API
* Agave API

The CIC group uses Deployer internally to manage deployments of its hosted offerings of the above systems, but external
groups can also use Deployer to manage their own on-premise deployments of these systems.



Organization of Documentation
_____________________________

The Deployer documentation is roughly organized into three sections: :doc:`getting-started/index`, which covers installation
and basic concepts; the `User Guide <users/index.html>`_, intended for operators who will use Deployer to manage deployments of one
or more of the supported projects and the `Developers Guide <developers/index.html>`_, which is intended for individuals wishing to develop
Deployer itself.
